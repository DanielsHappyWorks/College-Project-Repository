    <p>Welcome to our Anime distribution Site. Here you can purchase Anime Dvd sets at a discount.
    Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that 
    have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. 
    The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more 
    on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, 
    zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and 
    features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically 
    sized eyes.
